# NodeJS Udemy

### Projects made by instructions of a Udemy NodeJS course

I'm working on a remake of this. It's not finished, but you can access the repository [here](https://github.com/mwives/nodejs-udemy-ts-remake)

## Projects

### Notes App 🗒️

This one was used to teach the **fundamentals** of what NodeJS is. It uses the **Command Line** to **create**, **edit** or **remove** notes, which are stored in a JSON.

### Weather App ☁️

Used to teach what is an **API** and how to **fetch** data from an **external API**.

The data is fetched from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) and [WeatherStack](https://weatherstack.com/). HBS was used in the Front-end.

### Task Manager App 📝

Here I learned what is and created my very first **REST API**, with **authentication** and **test suites**.

#### Technologies
- MongoDB/Mongoose
- JWT
- SendGrid
- Jest

### Chat App 💬

In this one, I built a **real time chat** app, using AJAX and SocketIO.
